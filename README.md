ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Apache Iceberg.


## Overview

This is a work-in-progress I'm scaffolding with Gemini 2.0 Flash (and Flash Thinking). The AI slop/gold is in the `2025-.md`
files. I'm going to gradually copy this over and refine into the content I want to keep. I'm using close to the 1 million
context window of these models. This is completely amazing (as long as the results aren't mostly hallucinations).
